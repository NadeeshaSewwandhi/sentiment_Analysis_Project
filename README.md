# sentiment_Analysis_Project
Developed a machine learning-based system to detect and classify emotional text data as either positive or negative using a Kaggle sentiment dataset. The project involved cleaning and preprocessing text data with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to ensure model accuracy.

After testing various algorithms, Logistic Regression achieved the highest performance for sentiment classification. A simple, interactive Flask web application was built to allow users to input text and instantly receive sentiment predictions.

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning and NLP to understand human emotions in text, with potential use cases in customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and brand sentiment tracking.
